Advanced HTML goes beyond the basics of structuring web content and delves into more sophisticated techniques and features that enhance web development. This includes the use of semantic HTML5 elements, which improve accessibility and SEO by providing meaningful tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`. Advanced HTML also involves integrating multimedia elements such as audio and video with the `<audio>` and `<video>` tags, enabling richer content experiences. Techniques like lazy loading images and implementing responsive images using the `<picture>` element and `srcset` attribute ensure efficient loading and optimal display across different devices. Additionally, advanced HTML practices encompass the use of custom data attributes (`data-*`), microdata for embedding structured data, and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and properties to enhance accessibility. Mastery of these advanced HTML techniques empowers developers to create more dynamic, performant, and accessible web applications.
